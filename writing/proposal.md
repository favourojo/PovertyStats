##### Proposal Title : Differences in Rates of Poverty and Expenditures based on Gender (across African countries)

For our Data Analytics final project, we had originially decided to work on a project focused on Women and Pregnancy with a data set that contained natality data based on CDC-collected statistics for live births occurring within the United States to U.S. residents. After looking at that data set more closely, we realized that we would not be able to complete extensive analysis and comparisons among the data points. As a result, we went back to the resources shared with us and selected a new (and more extensive) data set, which has also shifted our research focus.

Our new data set is titled ["Harmonized Male/Female and Urban/Rural Subnational Expenditure, Poverty, and Inequality Indicators at 2011 PPP $1.90/day and $3.10/day for Africa South of the Sahara"](https://www.ifpri.org/publication/harmonized-malefemale-and-urbanrural-subnational-expenditure-poverty-and-inequality), coming from [Harvest Choice](https://harvestchoice.org), which looks at poverty headcount ratios derived from surveys and population census information. Specifically, this dataset caluclates poverty based on a "comparison between household per-capita consumption expenditure and the $1.90 and $3.10/day poverty lines expressed in international equivalent purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars (in 2011)". 

With this new data set, we are looking to answer the question of how rates of poverty (poverty headcount ratio, poverty gap, and poverty headcount) and spending (monthly per capita expenditures, food expenditures, and non food expenditures) differ based on gender across different African countries.

We anticipate to use ggplot to graphically present the data, as well as, conducting correlations to find statistically significant relationships between variables and single/multiple linear regressions to look at how variables influence each other. We are also planning to use dplyr functions like select() in order to select certain columns of the data set to run our analysis on.
